Multicollinearity Analysis with mtcars and Boston Datasets

Overview:
This repository includes the materials for a teaching session on multicollinearity and regression analysis using the mtcars and Boston datasets. The session covers essential concepts such as the impact of multicollinearity on regression models and how to detect it using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

Repository Contents:
1. A04_Pauta.pdf: Solution key with detailed answers and explanations for the problem set.
2. PautaT2.Rmd: R Markdown file containing the full analysis and code, including data cleaning, regression modeling, VIF calculation, and graphical visualizations.
3. T2_Pauta.do: Stata script to replicate the analysis, focusing on regression modeling and multicollinearity detection.
5. /datos: Folder containing the necessary data files for the analysis, including the classic mtcars.
6. The Boston dataset from the MASS package.

Key Concepts Covered: 
- Multicollinearity in Regression Models: Using the mtcars dataset to understand the effects of multicollinearity and interpret VIF values.
- Predictive Modeling with Boston Data: Splitting the Boston dataset into training and testing sets to build and evaluate regression models, addressing multicollinearity and model refinement.

Instructions for Use:
1. Load the Datasets: Use RStudio to run the provided scripts, ensuring all necessary packages are installed.
2. Run PautaT2.Rmd: Perform the analysis and generate a detailed report in R Markdown.
3. Run T2_Pauta.do: For those using Stata, replicate the analysis with this script.
4. Review A04_Pauta.pdf: Consult the solution key for explanations and insights into the analysis.
